      <h3>Proponents (Table 2)</h3>
      <p>The <a href="#bib-smpte-standards-operation-manual"></a> §6.3 requires <em>one or more Proponents, who are SMPTE Standards Members agreeing to be actively involved in the Project</em>. Proponents are individuals and not organizations. The first listed proponent will become the publicly visible main contact for the project. The proponent’s field is not publicly visible but can be seen by Standards Community members. Please extend the table as needed.</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Chair</dt>
          <dd>Just the name of the person who will be the main contact for the project. No email address – it will be on a public website. Usually the first listed proponent.</dd>
          <dt>Description</dt>
          <dd>A short description of the project’s purpose and objectives. This text is aimed at the public who will read it and thus should be able to understand the Project in general terms. There may be extra requirements for this field for the Public CD Process (<a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a>)</dd>
          <dt>Problem to be solved</dt>
          <dd>A short statement about the problem to be solved. Ideally phrased in terms of requirements such that when those requirements are met, the document is complete. There may be extra requirements for this field for the Public CD Process (<a href="#bib-smpte-ag-22"></a>)</dd>
          <dt>Project scope</dt>
          <dd>A short description of the scope of work that will be done and optionally elements that are out of scope. A narrow scope often results in a faster, more controlled project lifecycle. An example would be <em>“Revision of standard ST xxx to roll-up amendment ST-xxx-Amd-1 and to update the normative references”</em>. This limited scope is intended to restrict the work to just the details in the scope without opening the document up for redesign.</dd>
          <dt>Specific Tasks</dt>
          <dd>A high-level list of tasks that need to be completed as the work progresses. Consider test materials, sample bitstreams, sample software, data schemas, validation criteria, problem decomposition, liaisons with other organizations etc.</dd>
